<p id="description">I developed an event organization and registration platform where users can create manage and attend events. Event organizers have control over attendee lists and event details. Additionally the platform is equipped with Cypress tests for robust testing follows a streamlined workflow and is dockerized for efficient deployment and scalability. The admin user oversees all events and users ensuring centralized management with a focus on reliability and ease of use.</p>
